    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project proposes the design and evaluation of a dedicated Public Safety Broadband Network (PSBN)
        to support emergency response operations during high-impact events. The objective is to design
        a resilient, secure, and scalable communication infrastructure capable of maintaining operational
        integrity when conventional commercial networks experience congestion or failure.
